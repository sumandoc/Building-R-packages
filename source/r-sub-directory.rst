R/ sub-directory
================

The R sub-directory contains all of your R code, either in a single file, or in multiple files. For larger packages it's usually best to split code up into multiple files that logically group functions together. The names of the R code files do not matter, but generally it's not a good idea to have spaces in the file names.
