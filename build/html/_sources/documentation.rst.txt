Documentation
=============


There are two main types of documentation you may want to include with packages:

- **Longer documents** that give tutorials or overviews for the whole package
- **Shorter, function specific help files** for each function or group of related functions

You can create the first type of document using package ``vignettes, README files, or both``. For the function-specific help files, the easiest way to create these is with the ``roxygen2`` package.

In this section, we'll cover why and how to create this documentation. In addition, vignette / README documentation can be done using knitr to create R Markdown documents that mix R code and text, so we'll include more details on that process.
