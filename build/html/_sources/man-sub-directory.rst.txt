==================
man/ sub-directory
==================

The man sub-directory contains the **documentation files for all of the exported objects** of a package. With older versions of R one had to write the documentation of R objects directly into the man directory using a LaTeX-style notation. However, with the development of the `roxygen2 <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html>`_ package, we no longer need to do that and can write the documentation directly into the R code files. Therefore, you will likely have little interaction with the man directory as all of the files in there will be auto-generated by the `roxygen2 <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html>`_ package.



**SUMMARY**

R packages provide a convenient and standardized mechanism for distributing R code to a wide audience. As part of building an R package you design an interface to a collection of functions that users can access to make use of the functionality you provide. R packages are directories containing R code, documentation files, package metadata, and export/import information. **Exported functions** are functions that are accessible by the user; **imported functions** are functions in other packages that are used by your package.
